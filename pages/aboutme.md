Hello and welcome! I am a postdoctoral researcher interested in answering questions surrounding the origins and domestication of perennial crops, understanding how demography influences current crop productivity and quality, and how this information can be used to facilitate future crop improvement and genetic gain. Currently, I am developing genomic tools for both almond and pistachio to link with pest and disease response to improve rootstocks for these crops. Rootstocks can provide the grafted crop variety with resistance to soil borne pests and pathogens as well as tolerance to abiotic conditions or additional vigor.

Prior to postdoc life, I completed a **PhD in Genetics at the University of California-Davis**. My dissertation work focused on understanding the domestication of almond and peach and their evolution in the context of their closest wild relatives by examining selection, phylogeny, demography, and divergence. The domesticated almond and peach species are interfertile, a feature utilized to develop an important genetic map for the genus _Prunus_. However, more resources have been directed toward studying the domesticated peach, thus this work was an important step to understanding almond, peach, and their wild relatives in whole from a genome-wide approach.

Prior to doctoral work I was laboratory technician at the **USDA Agricultural Research Service National Clonal Germplasm Repository** where I DNA fingerprinted crop collections - e.g., grape, fig, walnut, cherry, peach, almond - and their wild relatives as well as a walnut F1 mapping population. Additionally, I also made interspecific crosses within _Juglans_ and _Prunus_ to generate hybrid progeny for evaluation as potential rootstocks. Working with these different collections was excellent for truly understanding the diversity of germplasm and its potential value for crop improvement.

You may ask how I ended up working with germplasm in the first place? While working on my **BS in Plant Biology at UC Davis**, I was very fortunate to receive mentorship from Paul Gepts and the very talented members of the [Bean Lab](https://psfaculty.plantsciences.ucdavis.edu/gepts/geptslab.htm), who focus on crop evolution, domestication, and biodiversity. This experience inspired my passion for and appreciation of germplasm, the potential of wild relatives, domestication, evolution, and plant breeding. It is my hope to help others understand the value of germplasm while providing guidance and inspiration on their unique journey of scientific discovery.
