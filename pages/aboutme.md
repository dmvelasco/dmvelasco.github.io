Hello, my name is Dianne! Let me tell you about my background and interests. I was born in California and raised from an early age in the Northern San Francisco Bay Area. I completed a **PhD in Genetics** in 2019 at the [**University of California, Davis**](https://www.ucdavis.edu) with [Jeff Ross-Ibarra](http://rilab.ucdavis.edu). However, my path to this achievement was not straightforward which may provide me with a different perspective than many.

## Pre-academia
My dissertation work focused on understanding the domestication of almond and peach and their evolution in the context of their closest wild relatives by examining selection, phylogeny, demography, and divergence. However, I have appreciated plants from an early age starting with cultivated species. After high school I gained a greater appreciation native California plants when I joined the [**California Conservation Corps**](https://ccc.ca.gov) (CCC) and was assigned to the Camarillo Center in Ventura County. During my time in Camarillo, not only did I train to respond to wildland fires, hazardous spills, floods, and perform CPR, but our primary conservation projects of trail rehabilitation, freeway landscaping, and flood mitigation took us throughout the Ventura, Santa Barbara, and Los Angeles counties of California. Much of the preserved areas of these counties, such as the Los Padres National Forest, are covered in coastal chaparral habitat and I learned about some of the more common plant species I encountered. Later I transfered to a CCC satellite station in Northern California with a native plant nursery. In support of the nursery mission to generate plants for native plant restoration, my fellow corpsmembers and I collected seed from various native plants in the coastal areas of Sonoma and Marin counties. Shortly after finishing my time with the CCC, I spent a season with the [**California Department of Fish and Wildlife**](https://wildlife.ca.gov)(DFW). During that one season we worked on a few restoration projects including building a cattle excluding but deer passable fence to protect vernal pools in Sonoma county, restoring riparian habitat through planting elderberry and willow trees in the Cache Creek Natural Area and California State Wildlife Area in Lake county, and preparing a wildlife water catchment reservoir for installation near Lake Berryessa in Napa county. After my time with DFW I spent some time persuing other vocations that ended with being laid off during the [post-9/11 economic downturn](https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Macroeconomic%20impact%209_11%202009.pdf) but also providing me the opportunity to restart my long paused post-secondary education.

## Undergraduate
I re-started my tertiary education at [**Santa Rosa Junior College**](https://www.santarosa.edu) (SRJC) completing my lower division coursework and graduating with an Associates of Science in Liberal Arts and Sciences. During a biodiversity module of my Fundamentals of Biology (Botany) course at SRJC we viewed the documentary ["Genetic Time Bomb" (de Graaf and Boe 1994)](https://www.videoproject.org/Genetic-Time-Bomb.html). The film discusses wild crop relatives, crop biodiversity, and some of the early plant explorers and crop domestication scientists, such as Nikolai Vavilov. This sparked an interest in the subject and shortly after transferring to the [**University of California, Davis**](https://www.ucdavis.edu) (UCD) as a **Plant Biology** major with a focus in **Genetics and Breeding**. As part of the **Transfer Student Fellowship Program** (TSFP) requirement to participate in research... During this time I had the opportunity to be mentored by Paul Gepts, Myounghai Kwak, and other members of the [Gepts Bean Lab](https://psfaculty.plantsciences.ucdavis.edu/gepts/geptslab.htm) which studies crop evolution, domestication, and biodiversity using multiple approaches. Graduated with a **Bachelors of Science in Plant Biology**.

## Germplasm
Immediately prior to my doctoral work I was a laboratory technician and manager at the [**USDA Agricultural Research Service National Clonal Germplasm Repository for Tree Fruit and Nut Crops and Grapes**](https://www.ars.usda.gov/pacific-west-area/davis-ca/natl-clonal-germplasm-rep-tree-fruit-nut-crops-grapes/) in Davis, Calif. where I DNA fingerprinted crop collections - e.g., grape, fig, walnut, cherry, peach, almond - and their wild relatives as well as a walnut F1 mapping population. Additionally, I also made interspecific crosses within _Juglans_, _Prunus_, or _Pistacia_ to generate hybrid progeny for evaluation as potential rootstocks. Working with these different collections was excellent for truly understanding the diversity of germplasm collections and their potential value for crop improvement.

## Graduate Studies
completed a [**PhD in Genetics at the University of California, Davis**](https://www.ucdavis.edu) with [Jeff Ross-Ibarra](http://rilab.ucdavis.edu). My dissertation work focused on understanding the domestication of almond and peach and their evolution in the context of their closest wild relatives by examining selection, phylogeny, demography, and divergence. The domesticated almond and peach species are interfertile, a feature utilized to develop an important genetic map for the genus _Prunus_. However, more resources have been directed toward studying the domesticated peach, thus this work was an important step to understanding almond, peach, and their wild relatives in whole from a genome-wide approach.

Relate to agriculture... My interests are in answering questions surrounding the origins and domestication of perennial crops, understanding how demography influences current crop productivity and quality, and how this information can be used to facilitate crop improvement. One aspect of my work has been in developing genomic tools in almond to associate soilborne pest response for selection of improved rootstocks. Rootstocks with resistance to soilborne pests provides the grafted scion cultivar with protection from soilborne pests and pathogens. Further investigation into abiotic stress tolerance of rootstocks also have great importance for selection.

You may ask how I ended up working with germplasm in the first place? While working on my **BS in Plant Biology at UC Davis**, I was very fortunate to receive mentorship from Paul Gepts, Myounghai Kwak, and other members of the [Bean Lab](https://psfaculty.plantsciences.ucdavis.edu/gepts/geptslab.htm), who focus on crop evolution, domestication, and biodiversity. This experience inspired my passion for and appreciation of germplasm, the potential of wild relatives, domestication, evolution, and plant breeding. It is my hope to help others understand the value of germplasm while providing guidance and inspiration on their unique journey of scientific discovery.

gardening, papercrafting, reading, beading
otherwise I occupy my time as a gardener, seed saver, food provisioner for a small flock of chickens, destroyer of invasive blacberry vines, and papercrafter

## Extra
Born in California and raised in the North Bay Area from an early age, I have experienced first-hand the periodic droughts and floods that affect the region. More recently cyclical swings between these extremes occur with greater intensity and increased frequency, as predicted by climate models. Utilizing crops resilient to these extremes and adopting sustainable or regernerative agricultural practices (such as mulching, composting, minimal soil disturbance, integrated animal ) to alleviate and mitigate the most detrimental effects in order for farmers to maintain their livelihood through reliable production (naive statement). Genetic improvement for improved water use efficiency, nutrient acquisition...
