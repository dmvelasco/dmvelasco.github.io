<center><i>“The planting of a tree, especially one of the long-living hardwood trees, is a gift which you can make to posterity at almost no cost and with almost no trouble, and if the tree takes root it will far outlive the visible effect of any of your other actions, good or evil.”</i><br /> ― George Orwell, <a href="http://orwell.ru/library/reviews/vicar/english/e_vicar">A Good Word for the Vicar of Bray</a></center>

Broadly, my research interests include domestication, evolution, genetics, and germplasm and their application to plant breeding, particularly perennial fruit and nut crops. I enjoy combining these lines of inquiry to better understand the genetic variation in germplasm and where selection has operated on the genome to identify loci of interest that may expedite breeding efforts in perennial crops.</p>

## Domestication of Tree Crops

Crop domestication is an area of study that seeks to understand not only how, but where and when humans began cultivating and directing the evolution of a crop and how that domesticated species differs from its progenitor and wild relatives. Domestication in perennial crops is less clear as the progenitor species are not always known, generation time can complicates some study methods, they retain a high degree of heterozygosity, and typically have a low degree of population structure. To gain a deeper understanding of their origins, modifications leading to their present morphology, and when and where these processes occurred has direct implications for crop improvement. Identifying the extent of genetic diversity of the domesticated crop and their wild relatives and how it is expressed may contribute to crop improvement, understanding selection within the domesticate and its wild relatives and which are likely to result in genetic gains. I am currently investigating the demographic history or changes in population size and structure over time and selection in <i>Prunus</i> subgenus <i>Amygdalus</i>, the subgenus with almond and peach, using genomic data. I really enjoy working with <i>Prunus</i> subgenus <i>Amygdalus</i> as a study system for domestication, but also feel it is an excellent system for understanding adaptation and mating system differences in trees. The major questions I hope to answer are: (1) What is the relationship between species of subgenus <i>Amygdalus</i>?, (2) Does selection in the subgenus correspond to domestication status, climate, or matingy system?, and (3) How can genetic diversity of wild species in <i>Prunus</i> subgenus <i>Amygdalus</i> be utilized for crop improvement?

Genetic gain through plant breeding is an essential means to ensure a stable, nutritious, and sustainable food supply. The ultimate goals of my research are to directly or indirectly facilitate this process by studying patterns of genetic diversity and understanding the inheritance of traits that are important for applied crop improvement. During my PhD, I used a diallel mating design, an F2 mapping population, and image-based phenotyping to describe the genetic architecture of shoot growth in carrots, which is important for successful crop establishment. As a postdoc, my research aims to understand how selection has influenced the genetic, morphological, and metabolic diversity present in <i>Brassica oleracea</i>, which, depending on who you ask, contains up to 14(!) distinct morphotypes. This species is especially exciting as it produces glucosinolates (also known as mustard oils), which impart the characteristic Brassica flavor, have co-evolved with pests, and have putative health benefits.
