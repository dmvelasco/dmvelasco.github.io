<center><i>“The planting of a tree, especially one of the long-living hardwood trees, is a gift which you can make to posterity at almost no cost and with almost no trouble, and if the tree takes root it will far outlive the visible effect of any of your other actions, good or evil.”</i><br /> ― George Orwell, <a href="http://orwell.ru/library/reviews/vicar/english/e_vicar">A Good Word for the Vicar of Bray</a></center>

Broadly, my research interests include domestication, evolution, genetics, and germplasm and their application to plant breeding, particularly perennial fruit and nut crops. I enjoy combining these lines of inquiry to better understand the genetic variation in germplasm and where selection has operated on the genome to identify loci of interest that may expedite breeding efforts in perennial crops.</p>

## Domestication of Tree Crops

Crop domestication is an area of study that seeks to understand not only how, but where and when humans began cultivating and directing the evolution of a crop and how that domesticated species differs from its progenitor and wild relatives. Domestication in perennial crops is less clear as the progenitor species are not always known, generation time can complicates some study methods, they retain a high degree of heterozygosity, and typically have a low degree of population structure. To gain a deeper understanding of their origins, modifications leading to their present morphology, and when and where these processes occurred has direct implications for crop improvement. Identifying the extent of genetic diversity of the domesticated crop and their wild relatives and how it is expressed may contribute to crop improvement, understanding selection within the domesticate and its wild relatives and which are likely to result in genetic gains. I am currently investigating the demographic history or changes in population size and structure over time and selection in <i>Prunus</i> subgenus <i>Amygdalus</i>, the subgenus with almond and peach, using genomic data. I really enjoy working with <i>Prunus</i> subgenus <i>Amygdalus</i> as a study system for domestication, but also feel it is an excellent system for understanding adaptation and mating system differences in trees. The major questions I hope to answer are: (1) What is the relationship between species of subgenus <i>Amygdalus</i>?, (2) Does selection in the subgenus correspond to domestication status, climate, or matingy system?, and (3) How can genetic diversity of wild species in <i>Prunus</i> subgenus <i>Amygdalus</i> be utilized for crop improvement?

Rootstock are commonly used with perennial crops for improved resistance to soilborne pests and pathogens, resilience to abiotic stressors, difficult to root cultivars or species, or ease of rootstock propagation and grafting. Throughout history rootstocks have been generated as seedling populations from open pollination or specific hybrid crosses. More recently growers have increasingly adopted clonally propagated selections of intra- or inter-specific hybrids due to their more consistent performance. The goals of my research are to develop or aid in the development of improved clonal rootstocks for tree crops. Rootstock development in woody perennials requires careful planning due to their life cycle. Progeny testing to identify trees of interest for use in directed crosses. During and prior to my PhD, I made interspecific crosses of _Juglans_, _Prunus_, and _Pistacia_ towards the efforts to identify a) novel individuals with superior performance to available rootstock varieties, b) generate populations gwas testing in collaboration with plant pathology screens, and c) identify trees within germplasm suitable for continued use in breeding efforts.</p>

But what have I done???? nothing

## Climate Resilience

The western US and other Mediterranean climates are characterized by no or negligible summer precipitation, however, water during the growing season is necessary for agricultural production. Climate change, as projected by climate models of the past several decades, has resulted in more extreme weather conditions, evidenced by California's second drought in the past X years only interspersed by floods. Resilience to drought is a key trait for crops to withstand fluctuations in water availability. Irrigation leads to excess salt build up and tolerance to this needed as well. Look for crops that are a) suitable for the changing climate, b) still economically worthwhile, c) do not further contribute to climate change, d) net reduction in greenhouse gas production

## Genetic Gain

Genetic gain through plant breeding is an essential means to ensure a stable, nutritious, and sustainable food supply. The ultimate goals of my research are to directly or indirectly facilitate this process by studying patterns of genetic diversity and understanding the inheritance of traits that are important for applied crop improvement. During my PhD, I used a diallel mating design, an F2 mapping population, and image-based phenotyping to describe the genetic architecture of shoot growth in carrots, which is important for successful crop establishment. As a postdoc, my research aims to understand how selection has influenced the genetic, morphological, and metabolic diversity present in <i>Brassica oleracea</i>, which, depending on who you ask, contains up to 14(!) distinct morphotypes. This species is especially exciting as it produces glucosinolates (also known as mustard oils), which impart the characteristic Brassica flavor, have co-evolved with pests, and have putative health benefits.

Specialty Crops
resilience to drought

reconsider more drought adapted crops

characterizing germplasm, familiarity with specialty crops & issues

what kind of applied research would i want to do that would improve specialty crops?
olive oil characterization of diff varieties? olive variety trials?
advertised position focus areas mention ornamental horticulture, specialty small grains.
apple is important, especially gravenstein. quince as specialty?
decently sized rose and dahlia places, as well as seed bank (baker creek).
fig, pomegranate, stone fruit, small fruit (blueberries, blackberry, raspberry), lavender
how big is home gardening, community gardens, garden clubs (I seem to recall there is a gardening club in Sonoma Co, not sure whether it is active)
county is non-gmo - regenerative ag? do livestock producers/processors and farmers (plant) work together/support each other? are there closed loop regenerative farms.
loads of farmers markets, how else are small farmers marketing their products
long history of variety trials/development in Sonoma County (Burbank)

drought, climate change, wildfire, abiotic resilience
hedgerows or other planting of natives to promote/support pollinator and wildlife diversity - see SAREP elderberry research

avocado for regional market? local sales. Camellia sinensis (tea)? hardy citrus?

apple, stone fruit, olive, meyer lemon, strawberry for deficit irrigation crops
