<center><i>“The planting of a tree, especially one of the long-living hardwood trees, is a gift which you can make to posterity at almost no cost and with almost no trouble, and if the tree takes root it will far outlive the visible effect of any of your other actions, good or evil.”</i><br /> ― George Orwell, <a href="http://orwell.ru/library/reviews/vicar/english/e_vicar">A Good Word for the Vicar of Bray</a></center>

Broadly, my research interests include perennial fruit and nut tree crop domestication, evolution, and germplasm and their use in plant breeding for increased pest, disease, and abiotic stress tolerance. I enjoy exploring these lines of inquiry to better understand genetic variation in germplasm and where selection has operated on the genome to identify loci of interest that may expedite breeding efforts in perennial crops. I feel this area is an important part of the broad efforts - such as regenerative and sustainable agriculture, agroecology, and integrated pest management - to reduce the impact of agriculure on the environment. My goal is for my research to be directly or indirectly applicable as an aid to farmers and gardeners.

Crop domestication is an area of study that seeks to understand not only how, but where and when, humans began cultivating and directing the evolution of a crop progenitor, as wll as how that domesticated species differs from its progenitor and wild relatives. Domestication in perennial crops is less clear as progenitor species are not always known, generation time complicates some methods of study and analysis, they retain a high degree of heterozygosity, and typically have a low degree of population structure compared to annual crops. To gain a deeper understanding of their origins, modifications leading to their present morphology, and when and where these processes occurred has direct implications for crop improvement. Identifying the extent of genetic diversity of the domesticated crop and their wild relatives and how it is expressed may contribute to crop improvement, understanding selection within the domesticate and its wild relatives and which are likely to result in genetic gains. I am currently investigating the demographic history or changes in population size and structure over time and selection in _Prunus_ subgenus _Amygdalus_, the subgenus with almond and peach, using genomic data. I really enjoy working with _Prunus_ subgenus _Amygdalus_ as a study system for domestication, but also feel it is an excellent system for understanding adaptation and mating system differences in trees. The major questions I hope to answer are: (1) What is the relationship between species of subgenus _Amygdalus_?, (2) Does selection in the subgenus correspond to domestication status, climate, or matingy system?, and (3) How can genetic diversity of wild species in _Prunus_ subgenus _Amygdalus_ be utilized for crop improvement?

## Rootstock Improvement

Rootstock are commonly used with perennial crops for improved resistance to soilborne pests and pathogens, resilience to abiotic stressors, difficult to root cultivars or species, or ease of rootstock propagation and grafting. Throughout history rootstocks have been generated as seedling populations from open pollination or specific hybrid crosses. More recently growers have increasingly adopted clonally propagated selections of intra- or inter-specific hybrids due to their more consistent performance. The goals of my research are to develop or aid in the development of improved clonal rootstocks for tree crops. Rootstock development in woody perennials requires careful planning due to their life cycle. Progeny testing to identify trees of interest for use in directed crosses. During and prior to my PhD, I made interspecific crosses of _Juglans_, _Prunus_, and _Pistacia_ towards the efforts to identify a) novel individuals with superior performance to available rootstock varieties, b) generate populations gwas testing in collaboration with plant pathology screens, and c) identify trees within germplasm suitable for continued use in breeding efforts.

Much of the western United States, particularly the Mediterranean climate of California, is characterized by no or negligible summer precipitation. However, agricultural production necessitates water use during the spring through fall growing season. Climate models produced during the past several decades through the present project extreme cyclical weather conditions due to climate change. This has become evident as California has cycled between drought and flood during the past X years. To withstand these fluctuations in water availability it is key for long lived crops to not only be resilient to drought but also flooding. Look for crops that are a) suitable for the changing climate, b) still economically worthwhile, c) do not further contribute to climate change, d) net reduction in greenhouse gas production.

## Genetic Gain
Genetic gain through plant breeding is an essential means to ensure a stable, nutritious, and sustainable food supply. The ultimate goals of my research are to directly or indirectly facilitate this process by studying patterns of genetic diversity and understanding the inheritance of traits that are important for applied crop improvement. During my PhD, I used a diallel mating design, an F2 mapping population, and image-based phenotyping to describe the genetic architecture of shoot growth in carrots, which is important for successful crop establishment. As a postdoc, my research aims to understand how selection has influenced the genetic, morphological, and metabolic diversity present in _Brassica oleracea_, which, depending on who you ask, contains up to 14(!) distinct morphotypes. This species is especially exciting as it produces glucosinolates (also known as mustard oils), which impart the characteristic Brassica flavor, have co-evolved with pests, and have putative health benefits.

Specialty Crops Advisor position Marin, Napa, and Sonoma counties
Indigenous peoples of course occupied and stewarded the lands of all three counties prior to colonization. The recorded agricultural histories of the counties post-colonization by Russia and Mexico have gone through many phases some of which, like viticulture, poultry farming, dairying, and ranching, are still active in the region. Sonoma county, in particular, is known widely not solely for viticulture and wine making but also as the headquarters for the experimental endeavors of Luther Burbank and thus specialty crops of tree fruit and nuts.
apples, particularly Gravenstein (other cultivars?)
olives (what cultivars?) primarily for olive oil. characterize diff varieties? olive variety trials?
Possible other specialty crops to consider, particularly in Sonoma County, are quince, meyer lemon, fig, pomegranate, lavender, small fruits (blackberry, raspberry, strawberry), avocado (CRFG has ), hops (making a resurgence, unfortunately may be more water intesnse)
nursery crops (export seems mostly related to viticulture)
characterizing germplasm, familiarity with specialty crops & issues
what kind of applied research would i want to do that would improve specialty crops? regenrative agriculture, dryland farming, wildfire, climate, hedgerows or other planting of natives to promote/support pollinator and wildlife diversity - see SAREP elderberry research
survey growers as to needs regarding growing or marketing what they already grow
county is non-gmo - regenerative ag? do livestock producers/processors and farmers (plant) work together/support each other? are there closed loop regenerative farms.
advertised position focus areas mention ornamental horticulture, specialty small grains (what are these? barley?).
ornamental - decently sized rose and dahlia places, as well as seed bank (baker creek).
responsibility for uc master gardener program
how big is home gardening, community gardens, garden clubs (I seem to recall there is a gardening club in Sonoma Co, not sure whether it is active)
loads of farmers markets, how else are small farmers marketing their products
avocado for regional market? local sales. Camellia sinensis (tea)? hardy citrus? hops?
apple, stone fruit, olive, meyer lemon, strawberry for deficit irrigation crops
Born in California and raised in the North Bay Area from an early age, I have experienced first-hand the periodic droughts and floods that affect the region. More recently cyclical swings between these extremes occur with greater intensity and increased frequency, as predicted by climate models. Utilizing crops resilient to these extremes and adopting sustainable or regernerative agricultural practices (such as mulching, composting, minimal soil disturbance, integrated animal ) to alleviate and mitigate the most detrimental effects in order for farmers to maintain their livelihood through reliable production (naive statement). Genetic improvement for improved water use efficiency, nutrient acquisition...
Since many perennial tree crops are clonally propagated, produced by grafting scion and rootstock cultivars, it is important to understand the genetic control of important traits in both and utilize that knowledge to breed for resilience to changing biotic and abiotic conditions. 
The introduction of scion cultivars may range from several years to multiple hundreds of years since introduction and are maintained clonally due to superior traits or value in breeding.
