Hello! I am a postdoctoral researcher interested in _using statistics, population genetics, and quantitative genetics to answer questions surrounding crop origins and domestication, how various demographic processes influence current crop productivity and quality, and how this information can be used to facilitate future crop improvement and genetic gain._ Currently, I am working on commodity board funded projects to develop genomic tools linked with disease resistance for rootstock improvment. **information about role of rootstocks**

Prior to postdoc life, I completed a **PhD in Genetics at the University of California-Davis**. My dissertation work focused on understanding the domestication of almond and peach and their evolution within the relationship to their closest wild relatives. (e.g. selection, phylogeny, demography, and divergence). Since most resources are understandably devoted to studying carrot roots, this was an important first step to breed varieties with improved weed competitive ability.

Prior to doctoral work was research technician at the USDA Agricultural Research Service National Clonal Germplams Repository where I DNA fingerprinted many of the clonal crops in the collections in addition to breeding work with walnut and stone fruit. **needs more work**

How did I end up working with germplasm in the first place? While working on my **BS in Plant Biology at UC Davis**, I was very fortunate to receive mentorship from Paul Gepts and the very talented members of the [Bean Lab](https://psfaculty.plantsciences.ucdavis.edu/gepts/geptslab.htm), who focus on crop evolution, domestication, and biodiversity. This experience inspired my passion and appreciation for germplasm, plant breeding, and understanding the potential of wild relatives. I hope to also inspire others to appreciate the value of germplasm and help them on their path to scientific discovery.
