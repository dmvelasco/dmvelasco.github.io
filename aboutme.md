Hello and welcome! I am a postdoctoral researcher interested in answering questions surrounding the origins and domestication of perennial crops, understanding how demography influences current crop productivity and quality, and how this information can be used to facilitate future crop improvement and genetic gain. Currently, I am developing genomic tools for both almond and pistachio to link with pest and disease response to improve rootstocks for these crops. Rootstocks can provide the grafted crop variety with resistance to soil borne pests and pathogens as well as tolerance to abiotic conditions or additional vigor.

Prior to postdoc life, I completed a **PhD in Genetics at the University of California-Davis**. My dissertation work focused on understanding the domestication of almond and peach and their evolution in the context of their closest wild relatives by examining selection, phylogeny, demography, and divergence. The domesticated almond and peach species are interfertile, a feature utilized to develop an important genetic map for the genus _Prunus_. However, more resources have been directed toward studying the domesticated peach, thus this work was an important step to understanding almond, peach, and their wild relatives in whole from a genome-wide approach.

Prior to doctoral work I was research technician at the USDA Agricultural Research Service National Clonal Germplasm Repository where I DNA fingerprinted many of the clonal crops in the collections in addition to breeding work with walnut and stone fruit. **needs more work**

How did I end up working with germplasm in the first place? While working on my **BS in Plant Biology at UC Davis**, I was very fortunate to receive mentorship from Paul Gepts and the very talented members of the [Bean Lab](https://psfaculty.plantsciences.ucdavis.edu/gepts/geptslab.htm), who focus on crop evolution, domestication, and biodiversity. This experience inspired my passion for and appreciation of germplasm, plant breeding, and understanding the potential of wild relatives. I also hope to also help others appreciate the value of germplasm and help inspire their scientific journey.
